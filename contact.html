        <p class='about-text'>Hey! My name is Victoria and I'm a second year student at Adelphi University. I am double majoring in Psychology and Spanish, so coding is more of a hobby for me!
        I'm more interested in the front-end part of web development and I really love graphic design.
        Some of my hobbies include sewing, painting, and playing the violin :) </p>
